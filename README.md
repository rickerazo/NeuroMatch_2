# NeuroMatch_2.0  
Experimental results of experimental neuroscience prepared for Neuromatch 2.0 virtual conference 2020  

Dear Colleagues,  
Thank you for your interest in my project. Please find the slides and video presentation in this repository.  
Also, feel free to browse my other Github repositories, I have python code to import and analyze electrophysiology data from leech and hamster, as well as code for simulations of simplified (leaky-integrate-and-fire) neurons and biophysical (Hodgkin-Huxley) neurons.
